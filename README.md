# Adventurekingdom

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

FlutterFlow projects are built to run on the Flutter _stable_ release.

### Getting started continued:

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

 Supabase Usage - 
 1. To store data - Yes, we have used supabase for data storage.
 2. Realtime -   No 
 3. Auth -  Yes, We have used supabase authentication
 4. Storage - No


I would like to emphasize a key point: the lack of available resources and videos on Dart Edge made it extremely challenging for our team to develop the Dart Edge functionality. Despite this obstacle, we persevered and successfully utilized Dart Edge for data create and read operations.
